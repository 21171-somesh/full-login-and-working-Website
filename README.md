[12:07 A.M. November 7 2017]: Website working but the only problem left to sort out is the dashboard and some "major routing issues"

[01:05 November 7 2017] Completed it !!!!! Its done and ready to rock the web with some minor changes and template designs and in some time the dashboard would be through angular which wouldmake the whole thing dynamic.One more thing is that i am not able to direct my login to my dashboard directly it has to go though this homepage so thats anothe minor bug. Everything major is fixed and ready to rock.
